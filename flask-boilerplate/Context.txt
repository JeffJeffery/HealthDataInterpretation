Use the following data to help patients understand their test results. 
Platelets are cells that cause the blood to clot. They are markers of bone marrow function. Platelets are non-nucleated, disk-shaped cells that function in hemostatic plug formation, clot retraction, and coagulation factor activation. They are produced by the bone marrow from megakaryocytes released into the bloodstream to function in hemostasis. For adults, the normal range value is 150,000 to 400,000 /µL or 150×109 to 400×109 /L. For children, the normal range depends on the age range. Premature and newborn children’s normal range is 100,000 to 300,000/µL  or 100×109 to 300×109 /L. N Neonate’s normal age range is 150,000 to 390,000 /µL 100×109 to 390×109 /L. At 3 months, the normal age range is 260,000/µL or 260×109 /L. Infant’s normal ranges are 200,000 to 473,000 /µL or 200×109 to 473×109 /L. At 1-10 years, the normal range is 150,000 to 450,000/µL or 150×109 to 450×109 /L. A high platelet count is called thrombocytosis. This may be due to infection, inflammation, trauma, previous operations, or medication. Thrombocytosis can cause complications like a stroke, heart attack, or a clot in your blood vessels (Cleveland Clinic). A low platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. Platelets are decreased in bleeding, liver disease, pregnancy, infection and due to medication. If thrombocytopenia is present, avoid rough physical activity and bumping into furniture. Use a stool softener and avoid straining to have a bowel movement. Use a soft toothbrush and watch for and report signs of bleeding: bruising, petechiae, blood in the stool/urine/sputum, bleeding from invasive lines, bleeding gums, abnormal or excessive vaginal bleeding.The test is used to check for leukemia and myeloma. The test is used to monitor or diagnose conditions that cause either too much bleeding or too much clotting.
